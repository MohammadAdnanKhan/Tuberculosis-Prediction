# 🦠 TB Prediction with Logistic Regression 🚀

Welcome to the **TB Prediction** project! In this repository, you'll find a logistic regression model developed to predict tuberculosis (TB) based on various patient features. Our goal is to leverage data to assist in early and accurate TB diagnosis. 🩺

## 📊 Project Overview

In this project, we have:

- **Developed a logistic regression model** to predict TB
- **Preprocessed the dataset** by encoding categorical variables and scaling features
- **Trained and evaluated the model** using metrics such as accuracy score
- Created **visualization plots** to assess model performance

## 🔍 Features

- **Patient Features:** Age, Gender, Symptoms, Test Results
- **Preprocessing Steps:** Encoding, Scaling
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity
- **Visualization:** Performance plots

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## 📈 Results
The logistic regression model achieved a balanced performance with good sensitivity and specificity, showing promising results for TB diagnosis.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Explore additional features to enhance model accuracy
- Compare different models for better performance
- Gather more data to improve robustness and real-world applicability
